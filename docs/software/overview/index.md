# Software Installation and Review

Software packages installed centrally on the Argon HPC system must comply with the **University of Iowa's software licensing policies**. Verifying compliance is a required part of the installation process and may take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on the complexity of the software license agreement.

In some cases, additional information may be needed from the requester to complete the review. Generally, the HPC team initiates the review process, but collaboration with the requester may be necessary. If the software was purchased by a college or department, the **collegiate or departmental IT staff** are typically best positioned to lead the review.

## License Scenarios and Review Requirements


<html>
  <button class="collapsible">Open Source Software with a Standard License</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p>
If the software is open source and licensed under one of the <b>pre-approved open source licenses</b>, it is already compliant and can be deployed without further review. </p>
  <p>
Refer to: <a href="https://www.lib.uiowa.edu/data/share-and-preserve-your-code/software-and-code-licenses/" target=_blank>Open Source Licensing – Technology Review | ITS </a></p>
  <p>
Once the distribution logistics are finalized, deployment can proceed.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">Freely Available or Open Source Software with a Non-Standard License</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p>
If the software uses a license not on the approved list—even if it is free or open source—it must go through the <b>technology review process</b>.
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Review details: <a href="https://its.uiowa.edu/available-software/technology-review-process" target=_blank>Technology Reviews Information | ITS</a></li> 
  </ul>
  <p>
  This review ensures there are no problematic clauses in the license. In some cases, <b>access restrictions</b> may be required. For example, software that requires registration for download or use may need controls to ensure compliance with academic or educational licensing terms.
  </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">Purchased Software with a License Agreement</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p>
  Software purchased with a formal license agreement typically requires the most extensive review. The <b>signed agreement</b> must be submitted for evaluation.
  </p>
  <p>
  Such software almost always requires a <b>defined access control scheme</b> before deployment is approved by the <b>University of Iowa General Counsel</b>.
  </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">Previously Reviewed Software</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> Some software may already be on the University's <b>Reviewed and Approved List</b>: </p>
  <p>   Check here: <a href="https://its.uiowa.edu/available-software" target=_blank>List of Reviewed Agreements | ITS</a></p>
  <p> Even if a software title is listed, we must verify that its license permits installation on an <b>HPC cluster</b>. Many licenses are limited to individual or departmental use and may <b>exclude cluster environments</b>. </p>
  <p> In such cases, deployment may still be possible, but only after defining and approving an appropriate <b>access control strategy</b>.</p>

## Post-Review 

Once the software has been reviewed and authorized, possibly with access controls, <mark>it can be deployed centrally on the Argon HPC system.</mark> While deployment logistics can often begin in parallel with the review process, please plan accordingly to allow time for all steps to be completed.
