# ITS Workshops and Training Materials

The Information Technology Services (ITS) regularly hosts workshops focused on **Basic Linux** and **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**. These sessions are designed to help researchers, faculty, staff, and students learn how to effectively use the university’s supercomputing cluster, **Argon**, for computational research.

This subsection provides **supplementary materials** for those workshops, including tutorials, and example scripts. If you're interested in attending a future workshop, please check the [ITS Research Services Workshops page](https://research.its.uiowa.edu/workshops) on details.

For technical documentation and detailed information about the Argon cluster, visit the [Argon wiki page](https://uiowa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/hpcdocs/pages/76513466/Argon+Cluster) If you do not yet have access, please visit the [Argon HPC service page](https://research.its.uiowa.edu/our-services/computing-services/argon-high-performance-computing-hpc). Accounts are available **at no cost** to **UI faculty, staff, and students** who are conducting research. Once your account is approved, you’ll be able to log in and begin using the cluster for your computational tasks.
